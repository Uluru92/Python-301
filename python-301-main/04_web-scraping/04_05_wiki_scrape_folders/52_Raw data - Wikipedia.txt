raw data

The two columns to the right of the left-most column in this computerized table are raw data.
Raw data
, also known as
primary data
, are
data
(e.g., numbers, instrument readings, figures, etc.) collected from a source. In the context of examinations, the raw data might be described as a
raw score
(after
test scores
).
If a scientist sets up a computerized
thermometer
which records the temperature of a chemical mixture in a test tube every minute, the list of temperature readings for every minute, as printed out on a spreadsheet or viewed on a computer screen are "raw data".  Raw data have not been subjected to processing, "cleaning" by researchers to remove
outliers
, obvious instrument reading errors or data entry errors, or any analysis (e.g., determining
central tendency
aspects such as the
average
or
median
result). As well, raw data have not been subject to any other manipulation by a software program or a human researcher, analyst or technician. They are also referred to as
primary
data. Raw data is a relative term (see
data
), because even once raw data have been "cleaned" and processed by one team of researchers, another team may consider these processed data to be "raw data" for another stage of research.  Raw data can be inputted to a
computer program
or used in manual procedures such as analyzing
statistics
from a
survey
. The term "raw data" can refer to the
binary
data on electronic storage devices, such as hard disk drives (also referred to as "low-level data").
Generating data
[
edit
]
Data has two ways of being created or made. The first is what is called 'captured data',
[
1
]
and is found through purposeful investigation or analysis. The second is called 'exhaust data',
[
1
]
and is gathered usually by machines or terminals as a secondary function. For example, cash registers, smartphones, and
speedometers
serve a main function but may collect data as a secondary task. Exhaust data is usually too large or of little use to process and becomes 'transient' or thrown away.

Examples
[
edit
]
In
computing
, raw data may have the following attributes: it may possibly contain human, machine, or instrument errors, it may not be validated; it might be in different area (
colloquial
) formats;
uncoded
or unformatted; or some entries might be "suspect" (e.g.,
outliers
), requiring
confirmation
or
citation
. For example, a data input sheet might contain dates as raw data in many forms: "31st January 1999", "31/01/1999", "31/1/99", "31 Jan", or "today". Once captured, this raw data may be
processed
stored as a normalized format, perhaps a
Julian date
, to make it easier for computers and humans to interpret during later processing. Raw data (sometimes colloquially called "sources" data or "eggy" data, the latter a reference to the data being "uncooked", that is, "unprocessed", like a raw
egg
) are the data input to processing. A distinction is  made between
data
and
information
, to the effect that information is the
end
product of
data
processing. Raw data that has undergone processing are sometimes referred to as "cooked" data in a colloquial sense.

Although raw data has the potential to be transformed into "
information
,"  extraction, organization, analysis, and formatting for presentation are required before raw data can be transformed into usable information.
For example, a
point-of-sale terminal
(POS terminal, a computerized
cash register
) in a busy supermarket collects huge volumes of raw data each day about customers' purchases. However, this list of grocery items and their prices and the time and date of purchase does not yield much information until it is processed. Once processed and analyzed by a
software program
or even by a researcher using a pen and paper and a
calculator
, this raw data may indicate the particular items that each customer buys, when they buy them, and at what price; as well, an analyst or manager could calculate the average total sales per customer or the average expenditure per day of the week by hour. This processed and analyzed data provides information for the manager, that the manager could then use to help her determine, for example, how many cashiers to hire and at what times.  Such
information
could then become
data
for further processing, for example as part of a predictive
marketing
campaign. As a result of processing, raw data sometimes ends up being put in a
database
, which enables the raw data to become accessible for further processing and analysis in any number of different ways.
Tim Berners-Lee
(inventor of the
World Wide Web
) argues that sharing raw data is important for society.

, meaning that everyone should demand that governments and businesses share the data they collect as raw data. He points out that "data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives… because somebody takes the data and does something with it." To Berners-Lee, it is essentially from this sharing of raw data, that advances in science will emerge. Advocates of
open data
argue that once citizens and civil society organizations have access to data from businesses and governments, it will enable citizens and NGOs to do their
own
analysis of the data, which can empower people and civil society. For example, a government may claim that its policies are reducing the
unemployment rate
, but a
poverty
advocacy group may be able to have its staff
econometricians
do their own analysis of the raw data, which may lead this group to draw different conclusions about the data set.
Critiques of raw data
[
edit
]
Critical data studies
scholars have critiqued the term
raw data
.
[

]
[

]
The critique stems from the idea that data can never be raw, instead data are always constructed and shaped by the decisions of people. Humanities scholar
Johanna Drucker
has argued that data are "
capta
, taken and constructed".
[

]
As an example, when data from a thermometer or other instrument is generated, the data is shaped by the configurations specific to the design of the instrument.
