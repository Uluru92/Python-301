Schema optimized for fast data retrieval
The
reverse star schema
is a
schema
optimized for fast
retrieval
of large quantities of descriptive
data
. The design was derived from a warehouse
star schema
,
[

]
and its adaptation for descriptive data required that certain key characteristics of the classic star schema be "reversed".
Model
[
edit
]
The relation of the central table to those in
dimension tables
is one-to-many, or in some cases many-to-many rather than many-to-one; the primary keys of the central table are the
foreign keys
in dimension tables, and the main tables are, in general, smaller than the dimension tables.
Main table columns are typically the source of
query
constraints, as opposed to dimension tables in the classical star schema. By starting queries with the smaller table, many results are filtered out early in the querying process, thereby streamlining the entire
search path
.
To add further flexibility, more than one main table is allowed, with main and submain tables having a one-to-many relation. Each main table can have its own dimension tables. To provide further
query optimization
, a data set can be partitioned into separate physical schemas on either the same
database server
or different database servers.
