In
computing
,
online analytical processing (OLAP)
(
/
ˈ
oʊ
l
æ
p
/
), is an approach to quickly answer
multi-dimensional analytical
(MDA) queries.
[
1
]
The term
OLAP
was created as a slight modification of the traditional database term
online transaction processing
(OLTP).
[
2
]
OLAP is part of the broader category of
business intelligence
, which also encompasses
relational databases
, report writing and
data mining
.
[
3
]
Typical applications of OLAP include
business reporting
for sales,
marketing
, management reporting,
business process management
(BPM),
[
4
]
budgeting
and
forecasting
,
financial reporting
and similar areas, with new applications emerging, such as
agriculture
.
[
5
]
OLAP tools enable users to analyse multidimensional data interactively from multiple perspectives. OLAP consists of three basic analytical operations: consolidation (roll-up), drill-down, and slicing and dicing.
[
6
]
: 402–403
Consolidation involves the aggregation of data that can be accumulated and computed in one or more dimensions. For example, all sales offices are rolled up to the sales department or sales division to anticipate sales trends. By contrast, the drill-down is a technique that allows users to navigate through the details. For instance, users can view the sales by individual products that make up a region's sales. Slicing and dicing is a feature whereby users can take out (slicing) a specific set of data of the
OLAP cube
and view (dicing) the slices from different viewpoints. These viewpoints are sometimes called dimensions (such as looking at the same sales by salesperson, or by date, or by customer, or by product, or by region, etc.).
Databases
configured for OLAP use a multidimensional data model, allowing for complex analytical and
ad hoc
queries with a rapid execution time.
[
7
]
They borrow aspects of
navigational databases
,
hierarchical databases
and relational databases.
OLAP is typically contrasted to
OLTP
(online transaction processing), which is generally characterized by much less complex queries, in a larger volume, to process transactions rather than for the purpose of business intelligence or reporting. Whereas OLAP systems are mostly optimized for read, OLTP has to process all kinds of queries (read, insert, update and delete).
Overview of OLAP systems
[
edit
]
At the core of any OLAP system is an
OLAP cube
(also called a 'multidimensional cube' or a
hypercube
). It consists of numeric facts called
measures
that are categorized by
dimensions
. The measures are placed at the intersections of the hypercube, which is spanned by the dimensions as a
vector space
. The usual interface to manipulate an OLAP cube is a matrix interface, like
Pivot tables
in a spreadsheet program, which performs projection operations along the dimensions, such as aggregation or averaging.
The cube metadata is typically created from a
star schema
or
snowflake schema
or
fact constellation
of tables in a
relational database
. Measures are derived from the records in the
fact table
and dimensions are derived from the
dimension tables
.
Each
measure
can be thought of as having a set of
labels
, or meta-data associated with it. A
dimension
is what describes these
labels
; it provides information about the
measure
.
A simple example would be a cube that contains a store's sales as a
measure
, and Date/Time as a
dimension
. Each Sale has a Date/Time
label
that describes more about that sale.
For example:
Sales Fact Table
+-------------+----------+
| sale_amount | time_id  |
+-------------+----------+            Time Dimension
|       930.10|     1234 |----+     +---------+-------------------+
+-------------+----------+    |     | time_id | timestamp         |
                              |     +---------+-------------------+
                              +---->|   1234  | 20080902 12:35:43 |
                                    +---------+-------------------+
Multidimensional databases
[
edit
]
Multidimensional structure is defined as "a variation of the relational model that uses multidimensional structures to organize data and express the relationships between data".
[
6
]
: 177
The structure is broken into cubes and the cubes are able to store and access data within the confines of each cube. "Each cell within a multidimensional structure contains aggregated data related to elements along each of its dimensions".
[
6
]
: 178
Even when data is manipulated it remains easy to access and continues to constitute a compact database format.  The data still remains interrelated. Multidimensional structure is quite popular for analytical databases that use online analytical processing (OLAP) applications.
[
6
]
Analytical databases use these databases because of their ability to deliver answers to complex business queries swiftly.  Data can be viewed from different angles, which gives a broader perspective of a problem unlike other models.
[
8
]
Aggregations
[
edit
]
It has been claimed that for complex queries OLAP cubes can produce an answer in around 0.1% of the time required for the same query on
OLTP
relational data.
[
9
]
[
10
]
The most important mechanism in OLAP which allows it to achieve such performance is the use of
aggregations
. Aggregations are built from the fact table by changing the granularity on specific dimensions and aggregating up data along these dimensions, using an
aggregate function
(or
aggregation function
). The number of possible aggregations is determined by every possible combination of dimension granularities.
The combination of all possible aggregations and the base data contains the answers to every query which can be answered from the data.
[
11
]
Because usually there are many aggregations that can be calculated, often only a predetermined number are fully calculated; the remainder are solved on demand. The problem of deciding which aggregations (views) to calculate is known as the view selection problem.  View selection can be constrained by the total size of the selected set of aggregations, the time to update them from changes in the base data, or both. The objective of view selection is typically to minimize the average time to answer OLAP queries, although some studies also minimize the update time. View selection is
NP-complete
. Many approaches to the problem have been explored, including
greedy algorithms
, randomized search,
genetic algorithms
and
A* search algorithm
.
Some aggregation functions can be computed for the entire OLAP cube by
precomputing
values for each cell, and then computing the aggregation for a roll-up of cells by aggregating these aggregates, applying a
divide and conquer algorithm
to the multidimensional problem to compute them efficiently.
[
12
]
For example, the overall sum of a roll-up is just the sum of the sub-sums in each cell. Functions that can be decomposed in this way are called
decomposable aggregation functions
, and include
COUNT, MAX, MIN,
and
SUM
, which can be computed for each cell and then directly aggregated; these are known as self-decomposable aggregation functions.
[
13
]
In other cases, the aggregate function can be computed by computing auxiliary numbers for cells, aggregating these auxiliary numbers, and finally computing the overall number at the end; examples include
AVERAGE
(tracking sum and count, dividing at the end) and
RANGE
(tracking max and min, subtracting at the end). In other cases, the aggregate function cannot be computed without analyzing the entire set at once, though in some cases approximations can be computed; examples include
DISTINCT COUNT, MEDIAN,
and
MODE
; for example, the median of a set is not the median of medians of subsets. These latter are difficult to implement efficiently in OLAP, as they require computing the aggregate function on the base data, either computing them online (slow) or precomputing them for possible rollouts (large space).
Types
[
edit
]
OLAP systems have been traditionally categorized using the following taxonomy.
[
14
]
Multidimensional OLAP (MOLAP)
[
edit
]
MOLAP (multi-dimensional online analytical processing) is the classic form of OLAP and is sometimes referred to as just OLAP. MOLAP stores this data in an optimized multi-dimensional array storage, rather than in a relational database.
Some MOLAP tools require the
pre-computation
and storage of derived data, such as consolidations – the operation known as processing. Such MOLAP tools generally utilize a pre-calculated data set referred to as a
data cube
. The data cube contains all the possible answers to a given range of questions. As a result, they have a very fast response to queries. On the other hand, updating can take a long time depending on the degree of pre-computation. Pre-computation can also lead to what is known as data explosion.
Other MOLAP tools, particularly those that implement the
functional database model
do not pre-compute derived data but make all calculations on demand other than those that were previously requested and stored in a cache.
Advantages of MOLAP
Fast query performance due to optimized storage, multidimensional indexing and caching.
Smaller on-disk size of data compared to data stored in
relational database
due to compression techniques.
Automated computation of higher-level aggregates of the data.
It is very compact for low dimension data sets.
Array models provide natural indexing.
Effective data extraction achieved through the pre-structuring of aggregated data.
Disadvantages of MOLAP
Within some MOLAP systems the processing step (data load) can be quite lengthy, especially on large data volumes. This is usually remedied by doing only incremental processing, i.e., processing only the data which have changed (usually new data) instead of reprocessing the entire data set.
Some MOLAP methodologies introduce data redundancy.
Products
[
edit
]
Examples of commercial products that use MOLAP are
Cognos
Powerplay,
Oracle Database OLAP Option
,
MicroStrategy
,
Microsoft Analysis Services
,
Essbase
,
TM1
,
Jedox
, and icCube.
Relational OLAP (ROLAP)
[
edit
]
ROLAP
works directly with relational databases and does not require pre-computation. The base data and the dimension tables are stored as relational tables and new tables are created to hold the aggregated information. It depends on a specialized schema design. This methodology relies on manipulating the data stored in the relational database to give the appearance of traditional OLAP's slicing and dicing functionality. In essence, each action of slicing and dicing is equivalent to adding a "WHERE" clause in the SQL statement. ROLAP tools do not use pre-calculated data cubes but instead pose the query to the standard relational database and its tables in order to bring back the data required to answer the question. ROLAP tools feature the ability to ask any question because the methodology is not limited to the contents of a cube. ROLAP also has the ability to drill down to the lowest level of detail in the database.
While ROLAP uses a relational database source, generally the database must be carefully designed for ROLAP use. A database which was designed for
OLTP
will not function well as a ROLAP database. Therefore, ROLAP still involves creating an additional copy of the data. However, since it is a database, a variety of technologies can be used to populate the database.
Advantages of ROLAP
[
edit
]
ROLAP is considered to be more scalable in handling large data volumes, especially models with
dimensions
with very high
cardinality
(i.e., millions of members).
With a variety of data loading tools available, and the ability to fine-tune the
extract, transform, load
(ETL) code to the particular data model, load times are generally much shorter than with the automated
MOLAP
loads.
The data are stored in a standard
relational database
and can be accessed by any
SQL
reporting tool (the tool does not have to be an OLAP tool).
ROLAP tools are better at handling
non-aggregable facts
(e.g., textual descriptions).
MOLAP
tools tend to suffer from slow performance when querying these elements.
By
decoupling
the data storage from the multi-dimensional model, it is possible to successfully model data that would not otherwise fit into a strict dimensional model.
The ROLAP approach can leverage
database
authorization controls such as
row-level security
, whereby the query results are filtered depending on preset criteria applied, for example, to a given user or group of users (
SQL
WHERE clause).
Disadvantages of ROLAP
[
edit
]
There is a consensus in the industry that ROLAP tools have slower performance than MOLAP tools. However, see the discussion below about ROLAP performance.
The loading of
aggregate tables
must be managed by custom
ETL
code. The ROLAP tools do not help with this task. This means additional development time and more code to support.
When the step of creating aggregate tables is skipped, the query performance then suffers because the larger detailed tables must be queried. This can be partially remedied by adding additional aggregate tables; however it is still not practical to create aggregate tables for all combinations of dimensions/attributes.
ROLAP relies on the general-purpose database for querying and caching, and therefore several special techniques employed by
MOLAP
tools are not available (such as special hierarchical indexing). However, modern ROLAP tools take advantage of latest improvements in
SQL
language such as CUBE and ROLLUP operators, DB2 Cube Views, as well as other SQL OLAP extensions. These SQL improvements can mitigate the benefits of the
MOLAP
tools.
Since ROLAP tools rely on
SQL
for all of the computations, they are not suitable when the model is heavy on calculations which don't translate well into
SQL
. Examples of such models include budgeting, allocations, financial reporting and other scenarios.
Performance of ROLAP
[
edit
]
In the OLAP industry ROLAP is usually perceived as being able to scale for large data volumes but suffering from slower query performance as opposed to
MOLAP
. The
OLAP Survey
[
usurped
]
, the largest independent survey across all major OLAP products, being conducted for 6 years (2001 to 2006) have consistently found that companies using ROLAP report slower performance than those using MOLAP even when data volumes were taken into consideration.
However, as with any survey there are a number of subtle issues that must be taken into account when interpreting the results.
The survey shows that ROLAP tools have 7 times more users than
MOLAP
tools within each company. Systems with more users will tend to suffer more performance problems at peak usage times.
There is also a question about complexity of the model, measured both in number of dimensions and richness of calculations. The survey does not offer a good way to control for these variations in the data being analyzed.
Downside of flexibility
[
edit
]
Some companies select ROLAP because they intend to re-use existing relational database tables—these tables will frequently not be optimally designed for OLAP use. The superior flexibility of ROLAP tools allows this less-than-optimal design to work, but performance suffers.
MOLAP
tools in contrast would force the data to be re-loaded into an optimal OLAP design.
Hybrid OLAP (HOLAP)
[
edit
]
The undesirable trade-off between additional
ETL
cost and slow query performance has ensured that most commercial OLAP tools now use a "Hybrid OLAP" (HOLAP) approach, which allows the model designer to decide which portion of the data will be stored in
MOLAP
and which portion in ROLAP.
There is no clear agreement across the industry as to what constitutes "Hybrid OLAP", except that a database will divide data between relational and specialized storage.
[
15
]
For example, for some vendors, a HOLAP database will use relational tables to hold the larger quantities of detailed data and use specialized storage for at least some aspects of the smaller quantities of more-aggregate or less-detailed data. HOLAP addresses the shortcomings of
MOLAP
and
ROLAP
by combining the capabilities of both approaches. HOLAP tools can utilize both pre-calculated cubes and relational data sources.
Vertical partitioning
[
edit
]
In this mode HOLAP stores
aggregations
in
MOLAP
for fast query performance, and detailed data in
ROLAP
to optimize time of cube
processing
.
Horizontal partitioning
[
edit
]
In this mode HOLAP stores some slice of data, usually the more recent one (i.e. sliced by Time dimension) in
MOLAP
for fast query performance, and older data in
ROLAP
. Moreover, we can store some dices in
MOLAP
and others in
ROLAP
, leveraging the fact that in a large cuboid, there will be dense and sparse subregions.
[
16
]
Products
[
edit
]
The first product to provide HOLAP storage was
Holos
, but the technology also became available in other commercial products such as
Microsoft Analysis Services
,
Oracle Database OLAP Option
,
MicroStrategy
and
SAP AG
BI Accelerator. The hybrid OLAP approach combines ROLAP and MOLAP technology, benefiting from the greater scalability of ROLAP and the faster computation of MOLAP. For example, a HOLAP server may store large volumes of detailed data in a relational database, while aggregations are kept in a separate MOLAP store. The Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 OLAP Services supports a hybrid OLAP server
Comparison
[
edit
]
Each type has certain benefits, although there is disagreement about the specifics of the benefits between providers.
Some MOLAP implementations are prone to database explosion, a phenomenon causing vast amounts of storage space to be used by MOLAP databases when certain common conditions are met: high number of dimensions, pre-calculated results and sparse multidimensional data.
MOLAP generally delivers better performance due to specialized indexing and storage optimizations. MOLAP also needs less storage space compared to ROLAP because the specialized storage typically includes
compression
techniques.
[
15
]
ROLAP is generally more scalable.
[
15
]
However, large volume pre-processing is difficult to implement efficiently so it is frequently skipped.  ROLAP query performance can therefore suffer tremendously.
Since ROLAP relies more on the database to perform calculations, it has more limitations in the specialized functions it can use.
HOLAP attempts to mix the best of ROLAP and MOLAP. It can generally pre-process swiftly, scale well, and offer good function support.

APIs and query languages
[
edit
]
Unlike
relational databases
, which had SQL as the standard query language, and widespread
APIs
such as
ODBC
,
JDBC
and
OLEDB
, there was no such unification in the OLAP world for a long time. The first real standard API was
OLE DB for OLAP
specification from
Microsoft
which appeared in 1997 and introduced the
MDX
query language. Several OLAP vendors – both server and client – adopted it. In 2001 Microsoft and
Hyperion
announced the
XML for Analysis
specification, which was endorsed by most of the OLAP vendors. Since this also used MDX as a query language, MDX became the de facto standard.
[

Since September-2011
LINQ
can be used to query
SSAS
OLAP cubes from Microsoft .NET.

History
[
edit
]
The first product that performed OLAP queries was
Express,
which was released in 1970 (and acquired by
Oracle
in 1995 from Information Resources).
[
28
]
However, the term did not appear until 1993 when it was coined by
Edgar F. Codd
, who has been described as "the father of the relational database". Codd's paper
[
1
]
resulted from a short consulting assignment which Codd undertook for former Arbor Software (later
Hyperion Solutions
, and in 2007 acquired by Oracle), as a sort of marketing coup.
The company had released its own OLAP product,
Essbase
, a year earlier. As a result, Codd's "twelve laws of online analytical processing" were explicit in their reference to Essbase. There was some ensuing controversy and when Computerworld learned that Codd was paid by Arbor, it retracted the article. The OLAP market experienced strong growth in the late 1990s with dozens of commercial products going into market. In 1998, Microsoft released its first OLAP Server –
Microsoft Analysis Services
, which drove wide adoption of OLAP technology and moved it into the mainstream.

OLAP clients include many spreadsheet programs like Excel, web application, SQL, dashboard tools, etc. Many clients support interactive data exploration where users select dimensions and measures of interest. Some dimensions are used as filters (for slicing and dicing the data) while others are selected as the axes of a pivot table or pivot chart. Users can also vary aggregation level (for drilling-down or rolling-up) the displayed view. Clients can also offer a variety of graphical widgets such as sliders, geographic maps, heat maps and more which can be grouped and coordinated as dashboards.
