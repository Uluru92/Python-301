Form in relational database normalization
Not to be confused with
Domain-key normal form
.
Sixth normal form
(
6NF
) is a
normal form
used in
relational database
normalization
which extends the relational algebra and generalizes relational operators (such as
join
) to support interval data, which can be useful in
temporal databases
.
The term 6NF has historically also been used to refer to another normalization degree, which today is more commonly known as
domain-key normal form
(DKNF) (see
Other meanings
).
Definition
[

Christopher J. Date
and others have defined sixth normal form as a
normal form
, based on an extension of the relational algebra.
[

[

[

]
Relational operators, such as
join
, are generalized to support a natural treatment of interval data, such as
sequences
of dates or moments in time, for instance in
temporal databases
.
[

]
[

[

]
Sixth normal form is then based on this generalized join, as follows:
A
relvar
R [table] is in sixth normal form (abbreviated 6NF) if and only if it satisfies no nontrivial join dependencies at all — where, as before, a
join dependency
is trivial if and only if at least one of the projections (possibly U_projections) involved is taken over the set of all attributes of the relvar [table] concerned.
[
5
]
Date et al. have also given the following definition:
Relvar R is in sixth normal form (6NF) if and only if every JD [Join Dependency] of R is trivial — where a JD is trivial if and only if one of its components is equal to the pertinent heading in its entirety.
[
6
]
Any relation in 6NF is also in
5NF
.
Sixth normal form is intended to decompose relation variables to
irreducible
components. Though this may be relatively unimportant for non-temporal relation variables, it can be important when dealing with temporal variables or other interval data. For instance, if a relation comprises a supplier's name, status, and city, we may also want to add temporal data, such as the time during which these values are, or were, valid (e.g., for historical data) but the three values may vary independently of each other and at different rates. We may, for instance, wish to trace the history of changes to Status; a review of production costs may reveal that a change was caused by a supplier changing city and hence what they charged for delivery.

Usage
[
edit
]
The sixth normal form is currently as of 2009 being used in some
data warehouses
where the benefits outweigh the drawbacks,
[
9
]
for example using
anchor modeling
. Although using 6NF leads to an explosion of tables, modern databases can prune the tables from select queries (using a process called '
table elimination
' - so that a query can be solved without even reading some of the tables that the query refers to
[
10
]
) where they are not required  and thus speed up queries that only access several attributes.

In order for a table to be in sixth normal form, it has to be in
fifth normal form
first and then it requires that each table satisfies only trivial join dependencies.
Let's take a simple example
[
11
]
with a table already in 5NF:
Here, in the users table, every attribute is non null and the primary key is the username:
Users_table
Username
Department
Status
This table is in 5NF because each join dependency is implied by the unique
candidate key
of the table (Username). More specifically, the only possible join dependencies are: {username, status}, {username, department}.
The 6NF version would look like this:
Users
Username
Status
Users_dept
Username
Department
So, from one table in 5NF, 6NF produces two tables.
Following is another example:
TABLE 1
Medic ID
Medic Name
Occupation
Type
Practice in years
1
Smith James
Orthopedic
Specialist
23
2
Miller Michael
Orthopedic
Probationer
4
3
Thomas Linda
Neurologist
Probationer
5
4
Scott Nancy
Orthopedic
Resident

Allen Brian

Turner Steven

3
7
Collins Kevin
Ophthalmologist
Specialist
7
8
King Donald
Neurologist
Resident
1
9
Harris Sarah
Ophthalmologist
Resident
2
The join dependencies of the table are {medic name, occupation}, {medic name, practice in years} and {medic name, type}. Hence we could see that such table is 2NF (due to the appearance of transitive dependency). The following tables try to bring it to 6NF:
TABLE 2.1
Medic ID
Medic Name
1
Smith James
2
Miller Michael
3
Thomas Linda

Scott Nancy

Allen Brian

Sixth normal form (6NF) is sometimes instead used as a synonym for
domain-key normal form
(DKNF). This usage predates Date et al.'s work.
