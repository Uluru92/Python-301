Dimensional Data modeling scenario
In the
data warehouse
practice of
extract, transform, load
(ETL), an
early fact
or
early-arriving fact
,
[
1
]
also known as
late-arriving dimension
or
late-arriving data
,
[
2
]
denotes the detection of a dimensional
natural key
during
fact table
source loading, prior to the assignment of a corresponding
primary key
or
surrogate key
in the
dimension table
.  Hence, the fact which cites the dimension arrives early, relative to the definition of the dimension value. An example could be backdating or making corrections to data.

Handling

]
Procedurally, an early fact can be treated several ways:
As an error: On the presumption that the dimensional attribute values should have been collected before fact source loading
As a valid fact, pause loading: The collection pauses whilst the missing dimensional attribute value itself is collected
As a valid fact, load with dummy keys: A primary key value is generated on the dimension with no attributes (stub / dummy row), the fact completes processing, and the dimension attributes are populated (overwritten) later in the load processing on the new row
Classify as a Suspense record: Assuming that the associated dimensional attribute was expected by process, move this fact record in a
Suspense
table and activate alert/SOPs (reporting mismatch [sum/count/aggr], business/data steward, manual correction etc.) In rare circumstances, the suspense records may also be combined (UNION) with the fact table to ensure the metrics are correctly calculated.
