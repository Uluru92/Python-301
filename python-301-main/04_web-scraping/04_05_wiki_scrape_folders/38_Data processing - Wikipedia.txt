Collection and manipulation of items of data to produce meaningful information

Data processing (disambiguation)

Data processing
is the
collection
and manipulation of digital data to produce meaningful information.
[
1
]
Data processing is a form of
information processing
, which is the modification (processing) of information in any manner detectable by an observer.

Functions
[
edit
]
Data processing may involve various processes, including:
Validation
– Ensuring that supplied data is correct and relevant.
Sorting
– "arranging items in some sequence and/or in different sets."
Summarization (statistical)
or
(automatic)
– reducing detailed data to its main points.
Aggregation
– combining multiple pieces of data.
Analysis
– the "collection,
organization
, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data."
Reporting
– list detail or summary data or computed information.
Classification
– separation of data into various categories.
History
[
edit
]
The
United States Census Bureau
history illustrates the evolution of data processing from manual through electronic procedures.
Manual data processing
[
edit
]
Although widespread use of the term
data processing
dates only from the 1950s,
[
2
]
data processing functions have been performed manually for millennia. For example,
bookkeeping
involves functions such as posting transactions and producing reports like the
balance sheet
and the
cash flow statement
. Completely manual methods were augmented by the application of
mechanical
or electronic
calculators
. A person whose job was to perform calculations manually or using a calculator was called a "
computer
."
The
1890 United States census
schedule was the first to gather data by individual rather than
household
. A number of questions could be answered by making a check in the appropriate box on the form. From 1850 to 1880 the Census Bureau employed "a system of tallying, which, by reason of the increasing number of combinations of classifications required, became increasingly complex. Only a limited number of combinations could be recorded in one tally, so it was necessary to handle the schedules 5 or 6 times, for as many independent tallies."

"It took over 7 years to publish the results of the 1880 census"
[

]
using manual processing methods.
Automatic data processing
[
edit
]
The term
automatic data processing
was applied to operations performed by means of
unit record equipment
, such as
Herman Hollerith
's application of
punched card
equipment for the
1890 United States census
. "Using Hollerith's punchcard equipment, the Census Office was able to complete tabulating most of the 1890 census data in 2 to 3 years, compared with 7 to 8 years for the 1880 census. It is estimated that using Hollerith's system saved some $5 million in processing costs"
[

in 1890 dollars even though there were twice as many questions as in 1880.
Computerized data processing
[
edit
]
Computerized data processing, or
electronic data processing
represents a later development, with a computer used instead of several independent pieces of equipment.  The Census Bureau first made limited use of
electronic computers
for the
1950 United States census
, using a
UNIVAC I
system,
[

delivered in 1952.
Other developments
[
edit
]
The term
data processing
has mostly been subsumed by the more general term
information technology
(IT).
[
5
]
The older term "data processing" is suggestive of older technologies. For example, in 1996 the
Data Processing Management Association
(DPMA) changed its name to the
Association of Information Technology Professionals
. Nevertheless, the terms are approximately synonymous.
Applications
[
edit
]
Commercial data processing
[
edit
]
Main article:
Electronic data processing
Commercial data processing involves a large volume of input data, relatively few computational operations, and a large volume of output. For example, an insurance company needs to keep records on tens or hundreds of thousands of policies, print and mail bills, and receive and post payments.
Data analysis
[
edit
]
Main article:
Data analysis
In science and engineering, the terms
data processing
and
information systems
are considered too broad, and the term
data processing
is typically used for the initial stage followed by a
data analysis
in the second stage of the overall data handling.
Data analysis uses specialized
algorithms
and
statistical
calculations that are less often observed in a typical general business environment. For data analysis, software suites like
SPSS
or
SAS
, or their free counterparts such as
DAP
,
gretl
, or
PSPP
are often used. These tools are usually helpful for processing various huge data sets, as they are able to handle enormous amount of statistical analysis.

Systems
[
edit
]
A
data processing system
is a combination of
machines
, people, and processes that for a set of
inputs
produces a defined set of
outputs
. The inputs and outputs are interpreted as
data
,
facts
,
information
etc. depending on the interpreter's relation to the system.
A term commonly used synonymously with
data or storage (codes) processing system
is
information system
.
[

With regard particularly to
electronic data processing
, the corresponding concept is referred to as
electronic data processing system
.
Examples
[
edit
]
Simple example
[
edit
]
A very simple example of a data processing system is the process of maintaining a check register. Transactions— checks and deposits— are recorded as they occur and the transactions are summarized to determine a current balance. Monthly the data recorded in the register is reconciled with a hopefully identical list of transactions processed by the bank.
A more sophisticated record keeping system might further identify the transactions— for example deposits by source or checks by type, such as charitable contributions. This information might be used to obtain information like the total of all contributions for the year.
The important thing about this example is that it is a
system
, in which, all transactions are recorded consistently, and the same method of bank reconciliation is used each time.

Data processing is distinct from
word processing
, which is manipulation of text specifically rather than data generally.
