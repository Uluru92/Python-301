From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
XML for Analysis
(
XMLA
) is an industry standard for data access in analytical systems, such as
online analytical processing
(OLAP) and
data mining
. XMLA is based on other industry standards such as
XML
,
SOAP
and
HTTP
. XMLA is maintained by
XMLA Council
with
Microsoft
,
Hyperion
and
SAS Institute
being the XMLA Council founder members.
History
[
edit
]
The XMLA specification was first proposed by
Microsoft
as a successor for
OLE DB for OLAP
in April 2000. By January 2001 it was joined by
Hyperion
endorsing XMLA. The 1.0 version of the standard was released in April 2001, and in September 2001 the XMLA Council was formed. In April 2002
SAS
joined Microsoft and Hyperion as founding member of XMLA Council.

With time, more than 25 companies joined with their support for the standard.
API
[
edit
]
XMLA consists of only two
SOAP
methods: execute and discover.
[

]
It was designed in such a way to preserve simplicity.
Execute
[
edit
]
Execute method has two parameters:
Command - command to be executed. It can be
MDX
,
DMX
or
SQL
.
Properties -
XML
list of command properties such as Timeout, Catalog name, etc.
The result of Execute command could be
Multidimensional Dataset
or
Tabular Rowset
.
Discover
[
edit
]
Discover method was designed to model all the discovery methods possible in
OLEDB
including various schema rowset, properties, keywords, etc. Discover method allows users to specify both what needs to be discovered and the possible restrictions or properties.
The result of Discover method is a rowset.
Query language
[
edit
]
XMLA specifies
MDXML
as the query language. In the XMLA 1.1 version, the only construct in MDXML is an
MDX
statement enclosed in the <Statement> tag.

Example
[
edit
]
Below is an example of XMLA Execute request with MDX query in command.
<soap:Envelope>
<soap:Body>
<Execute
xmlns=
"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xml-analysis"
>
<Command>
<Statement>
SELECT
Measures.MEMBERS
ON
COLUMNS
FROM
Sales
</Statement>
</Command>
<Properties>
<PropertyList>
<DataSourceInfo/>
<Catalog>
FoodMart
</Catalog>
<Format>
Multidimensional
</Format>
<AxisFormat>
TupleFormat
</AxisFormat>
</PropertyList>
</Properties>
</Execute>
</soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
Session management
[
edit
]
XMLA has a notion of
session state
. It is maintained through predefined
SOAP
headers
BeginSession - to begin a new session
EndSession - to end existing session
UseSession - to use existing session. SessionId attribute previously returned for BeginSession should be used.
