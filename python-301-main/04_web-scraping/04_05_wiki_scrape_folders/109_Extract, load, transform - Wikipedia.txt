Extract, load, transform
(
ELT
) is an alternative to
extract, transform, load
(ETL) used with
data lake
implementations. In contrast to ETL, in ELT models the
data
is not transformed on entry to the data lake, but stored in its original raw format. This enables faster loading times. However, ELT requires sufficient processing power within the
data processing
engine to carry out the transformation on demand, to return the results in a timely manner.

Since the data is not processed on entry to the data lake, the query and schema do not need to be defined a priori (although often the schema will be available during load since many data sources are extracts from databases or similar structured data systems and hence have an associated schema). ELT is a data
pipeline
model.
