Data extraction
is the act or process of retrieving
data
out of (usually
unstructured
or poorly structured) data sources for further
data processing
or
data storage
(
data migration
). The
import
into the intermediate extracting system is thus usually followed by
data transformation
and possibly the addition of
metadata
prior to
export
to another stage in the data
workflow
.
Usually, the term data extraction is applied when (
experimental
) data is first imported into a computer from primary sources, like
measuring
or
recording devices
. Today's
electronic devices
will usually present an
electrical connector
(e.g.
USB
) through which '
raw data
' can be
streamed
into a
personal computer
.
Data sources
[
edit
]
Typical unstructured data sources include
web pages
,
emails
, documents,
PDFs
, social media, scanned text, mainframe reports, spool files, multimedia files, etc. Extracting data from these unstructured sources has grown into a considerable technical challenge, where as historically data extraction has had to deal with changes in physical hardware formats, the majority of current data extraction deals with extracting data from these unstructured data sources, and from different software formats. This growing process of data extraction from the web is referred to as "Web data extraction" or "
Web scraping
".
Imposing structure
[
edit
]
The act of adding structure to unstructured data takes a number of forms
Using text
pattern matching
such as
regular expressions
to identify small or large-scale structure e.g. records in a report and their associated data from headers and footers;
Using a table-based approach to identify common sections within a limited domain e.g. in emailed resumes, identifying skills, previous work experience, qualifications etc. using a standard set of commonly used headings (these would differ from language to language), e.g. Education might be found under Education/Qualification/Courses;
Using
text analytics
to attempt to understand the text and link it to other information
