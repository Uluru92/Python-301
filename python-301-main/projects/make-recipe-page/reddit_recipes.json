        "reddit_link": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1lxc1jc/okra_in_tomato_sauce/",
        "recipe_text": "Let’s talk about okra, or bamya, or gumbo, or lady fingers, depending on where you're from. It’s one of those vegetables that shows up in so many cultures, yet still feels a bit mysterious to most people.\n\nHonestly, even the origins of okra are kind of a mystery. Some say it's from West Africa, others say India. It grows all over the tropics, in North Africa, in the Middle East, even in Southern Europe, though it was the Arabs who brought it to the Mediterranean, as far as we know.\nIn our home, we call it bamya, and it’s something I cook often, especially when I want something light but still filling. It’s a low-calorie, fiber-packed veggie, only about 31 calories per 100 grams, so if you’re trying to eat healthy, or just not feel heavy after dinner, it’s a great choice.\nTraditionally in Egypt, bamya is cooked with meat. Usually lamb or beef. But since not everyone in my house eats meat, I make it vegetarian most of the time, and honestly, I don’t miss the meat at all.\n**Ingredients:**\n+ 500g okra (fresh or frozen)\n+ 1 onion, chopped\n+ 3–4 cloves of garlic, minced\n+ 6–7 tomatoes, peeled and blended\n+ 1 tablespoon tomato paste (only if the tomatoes are too watery or pale)\n+ 1 teaspoon ground coriander\n+ 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n+ ½ teaspoon paprika\n+ ½ teaspoon red chili flakes\n+ ½ teaspoon black pepper\n+ Salt, to taste\n+ 2–3 tablespoons vegetable oil\n+ Lemon wedges for serving\n**Preparation:**\n1.First, prep your tomatoes. If they’re really juicy and red, great, just peel and blend them. If they’re bland or watery, and honestly, sometimes they are, add a spoonful of tomato paste to boost the flavor and color.\n2.If you're using fresh okra, rinse it really well, pat it dry, and trim the stem end carefully. Try not to cut into the pod itself or it’ll get slimy later. If it’s frozen okra, skip all that. Just throw it in straight from the freezer. No thawing.\n3.In a large pot, heat the oil. Add the chopped onion and garlic and sauté for 3–4 minutes until soft and fragrant.\n4.Add the okra and stir for a few minutes to coat it in the onion and garlic oil. Then pour in the blended tomatoes.\n5.Add all your spices: coriander, cumin, paprika, chili, black pepper. Give it a good stir.\n6.Cover the pot and let everything simmer on low for about 45 minutes. Don’t rush it, slow cooking brings out the sweetness of the tomatoes and makes the okra super tender.\n7.At the end, add salt to taste and squeeze in some fresh lemon juice. That bit of acid really brings the whole thing together.\n8.I like serving bamya with plain white rice, maybe some flatbread on the side. You can keep it vegan, or top it with boiled or fried meat or chicken if that’s your thing. It’s a flexible dish, one of those recipes that lets you make it your own without losing the soul of it.\n9.Some days I’ll sprinkle fresh parsley or cilantro on top. Other days I won’t bother. It gives a special taste."
